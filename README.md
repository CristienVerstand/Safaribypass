# Safaribypass

This tool is a **proof of concept** of how you could unleash a web driver that is designed to make web app testing, but useful for automating processes such as exploiting trial mode of some services with the creation of temporary emails and fictitious recordings. The tool has been programmed to be used for the safari service of O' Reilly.

## How to use

* Run ./install.sh as sudo.
* Run Geckodriver and select the port with --port (number) argument.
* Run the safaribypass: python3 safaibypass.py
